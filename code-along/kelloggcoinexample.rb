# Cryptocurrency is all the rage. You have decided to create your own,
# KelloggCoin, that will massively disrupt financial markets at the Global
# Hub.

# Don't change the following code, which represents a series of transactions, each
# of which represents a transfer of KelloggCoin from one user to another – transactions 
# with no from_user are from the "ICO" (Initial Coin Offering)

blockchain = [
  { "from_user" => nil, "to_user" => "ben", "amount" => 20000 },
  { "from_user" => nil, "to_user" => "brian", "amount" => 20000 },
  { "from_user" => "ben", "to_user" => "evan", "amount" => 9000 },
  { "from_user" => "brian", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 7000 },
  { "from_user" => "evan", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 400 },
  { "from_user" => "ben", "to_user" => "anthony", "amount" => 1500 },
  { "from_user" => "anthony", "to_user" => "ben", "amount" => 4500 },
  { "from_user" => "anthony", "to_user" => "evan", "amount" => 1750 }
]

# Write code below that returns the number of KelloggCoin that each user has in their 
# KelloggCoin "wallet".

# It should print out:
# Ben's KelloggCoin balance is 14000
# Brian's KelloggCoin balance is 13000
# Evan's KelloggCoin balance is 10350
# Anthony's KelloggCoin balance is 2650

# 👇👇👇 Your code HERE 👇👇👇

# create 4 variables to represent each user's balance
bens_balance = 0
brians_balance = 0
evans_balance = 0
anthonys_balance = 0

# loop through the "blockchain" and increment/decrement the balances accordingly

for transaction in blockchain
  # each "transaction" in the "blockchain" array is a Hash

  # if the user is the "from_user", decrement their balance
  
  if transaction["from_user"] == "ben"
    bens_balance = bens_balance - transaction["amount"]
  elsif transaction["from_user"] == "brian"
    brians_balance = brians_balance - transaction["amount"]
  elsif transaction["from_user"] == "evan"
    evans_balance = evans_balance - transaction["amount"]
  elsif transaction["from_user"] == "anthony"
    anthonys_balance = anthonys_balance - transaction["amount"]
  end

  # if the user is the "to_user", increment their balance
  if transaction["to_user"] == "ben"
    bens_balance = bens_balance + transaction["amount"]
  elsif transaction["to_user"] == "brian"
    brians_balance = brians_balance + transaction["amount"]
